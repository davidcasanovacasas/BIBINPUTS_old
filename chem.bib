In D2 both 1 and 3 are stable, whereas 2 slowly reacts. The different reactivity of the three carbenes is rationalized in terms of differing carbene stabilization energies.},

It is shown that their multiradical nature leads to a unique dependence of the γcomponent along the armchair edges and that this behavior can be rationalized not only in terms of the diradical character (y0) derived from the HOMO and LUMO occupation numbers, but also in terms of the one (y1) derived from the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 ones: the γcomponents are enhanced when the systems take intermediate y1 values in addition to intermediate y0 values.},

	n2 = {It might seem that the existence of a dramatic diminution in molecular conductance across a hydrocarbon (quantum interference, QI) would be unrelated to the existence of an important class of organic molecules with two electrons in two orbitals, diradicals. However, if you add two carbons to a planar π-electron hydrocarbon, you get a diradical if and only if there is a QI feature in conductance when two electrodes are attached to the molecule at the same sites. When you remove the two carbons where the electrodes are attached, you also generate a diradical. The connection, first empirically observed, is proven. Two kinds of diradicals, with different ground state spin consequences, are also easily distinguished by the relationship.An empirical observation of a relationship between a striking feature of electronic transmission through a π-system, destructive quantum interference (QI), on one hand, and the stability of diradicals on the other, leads to the proof of a general theorem that relates the two. Subject to a number of simplifying assumptions, in a π-electron system, QI occurs when electrodes are attached to those positions of an N-carbon atom N-electron closed-shell hydrocarbon where the matrix elements of the Green's function vanish. These zeros come in two types, which are called easy and hard. Suppose an N+2 atom, N+2 electron hydrocarbon is formed by substituting 2 CH2 groups at two atoms, where the electrodes were. Then, if a QI feature is associated with electrode attachment to the two atoms of the original N atom system, the resulting augmented N+2 molecule will be a diradical. If there is no QI feature, i.e., transmission of current is normal if electrodes are attached to the two atoms, the resulting hydrocarbon will not be a diradical but will have a classical closed-shell electronic structure. Moreover, where a diradical exists, the easy zero is associated with a nondisjoint diradical, and the hard zero is associated with a disjoint one. A related theorem is proven for deletion of two sites from a hydrocarbon.},

Vibrational levels up tov= 8 in theb3Σ−andv= 7 in thea3Π state were observed, allowing construction of RKR potential curves covering almost 80% of the well depths. Dissociation energies were estimated from the observed vibrational levels using the near-dissociation extrapolation method. Comparison of the extrapolated curves with theoretical calculations resulted in the following best estimates for the dissociation energies:a3ΠDe= 19250 cm−1,b3Σ−De= 20960 cm−1. The BH singlet--triplet separation is estimated to be 10410 cm−1. The recently observed predissociation of theb3Σ−state was too weak to be detected.},

@article{Szajna:AlH:2010,
	abstract = {The ultraviolet spectrum of AlH has been investigated at high resolution between 42000 and 45000cm−1 using a conventional spectroscopic technique. The AlH molecules were formed and excited in an aluminium hollow-cathode lamp with two anodes, filled with a mixture of Ne carried gas and a trace of NH3. The emission from the discharge was observed with a plane grating spectrograph and recorded by a photomultiplier tube. The 0--0, 1--1 and 1--2 bands of the C1Σ+--X1Σ+ transition have been identified and rotationally analyzed. The new data were elaborated with help of recent X1Σ+ state parameters reported by White et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 99 (1993) 8371--8378] and by Szajna and Zachwieja [Eur. Phys. J. D. 55 (2009) 549--555]. Determined constants of the excited C1Σ+ state include: Te=44675.3711(57)cm−1, ωe=1575.3357(42)cm−1, ωexe=[125.5]cm−1, Be=6.66804(32)cm−1, αe=0.55839(56)cm−1, De=2.23(13)×10−4cm−1, βe=6.13(25)×10−4cm−1 and re=1.613132(39) {\AA}. The C1Σ+ state is found to be extensively perturbed in the v=0 and 1 vibrational level at J=20, 22−27 and J=5−9, respectively. This was probably caused by the interaction with the vibrational levels of the outer minimum.},
