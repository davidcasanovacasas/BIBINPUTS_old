@article{Brazier:BH:1996,
	Abstract = {Theb3Σ−--a3Π system of BH has been extensively characterized by emission spectroscopy using a CESE source. Vibrational levels up tov= 8 in theb3Σ−andv= 7 in thea3Π state were observed, allowing construction of RKR potential curves covering almost 80% of the well depths. Dissociation energies were estimated from the observed vibrational levels using the near-dissociation extrapolation method. Comparison of the extrapolated curves with theoretical calculations resulted in the following best estimates for the dissociation energies:a3ΠDe= 19250 cm−1,b3Σ−De= 20960 cm−1. The BH singlet--triplet separation is estimated to be 10410 cm−1. The recently observed predissociation of theb3Σ−state was too weak to be detected.},

@article{Szajna:AlH:2010,
	Abstract = {The ultraviolet spectrum of AlH has been investigated at high resolution between 42000 and 45000cm−1 using a conventional spectroscopic technique. The AlH molecules were formed and excited in an aluminium hollow-cathode lamp with two anodes, filled with a mixture of Ne carried gas and a trace of NH3. The emission from the discharge was observed with a plane grating spectrograph and recorded by a photomultiplier tube. The 0--0, 1--1 and 1--2 bands of the C1Σ+--X1Σ+ transition have been identified and rotationally analyzed. The new data were elaborated with help of recent X1Σ+ state parameters reported by White et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 99 (1993) 8371--8378] and by Szajna and Zachwieja [Eur. Phys. J. D. 55 (2009) 549--555]. Determined constants of the excited C1Σ+ state include: Te=44675.3711(57)cm−1, ωe=1575.3357(42)cm−1, ωexe=[125.5]cm−1, Be=6.66804(32)cm−1, αe=0.55839(56)cm−1, De=2.23(13)×10−4cm−1, βe=6.13(25)×10−4cm−1 and re=1.613132(39) {\AA}. The C1Σ+ state is found to be extensively perturbed in the v=0 and 1 vibrational level at J=20, 22−27 and J=5−9, respectively. This was probably caused by the interaction with the vibrational levels of the outer minimum.},
