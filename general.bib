@article{Poli:spin_forbidden:2003,
	Abstract = {Many reactions of transition metal compounds involve a change in spin. These reactions may proceed faster{,} slower---or at the same rate as---otherwise equivalent processes in which spin is conserved. For example{,} ligand substitution in [CpMo(Cl)2(PR3)2] is faster than expected{,} whereas addition of dinitrogen to [Cp*Mo(Cl)(PMe3)2] is slow. Spin-forbidden oxidative addition of ethylene to [Cp*Ir(PMe3)] occurs competitively with ligand association. To explain these observations{,} we discuss the shape of the different potential energy surfaces (PESs) involved{,} and the energy of the minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) between them. This computational approach is of great help in understanding the mechanisms of spin-forbidden reactions{,} provided that accurate calculations can be used to predict the relevant PESs. Density functional theory{,} especially using gradient-corrected and hybrid functionals{,} performs reasonably well for the difficult problem of predicting the energy splitting between different spin states of transition metal complexes{,} although careful calibration is needed.},

	N2 = {Abstract Many light-induced molecular processes involve a change in spin state and are formally forbidden in non-relativistic quantum theory. To make them happen, spin?orbit coupling (SOC) has to be invoked. Intersystem crossing (ISC), the nonradiative transition between two electronic states of different multiplicity, plays a key role in photochemistry and photophysics with a broad range of applications including molecular photonics, biological photosensors, photodynamic therapy, and materials science. Quantum chemistry has become a valuable tool for gaining detailed insight into the mechanisms of ISC. After a short introduction highlighting the importance of ISC and a brief description of the relativistic origins of SOC, this article focusses on approximate SOC operators for practical use in molecular applications and reviews state-of-the-art theoretical methods for evaluating ISC rates. Finally, a few sample applications are discussed that underline the necessity of studying the mechanisms of ISC processes beyond qualitative rules such as the El-Sayed rules and the energy gap law. ? 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

@inbook{Pederson:magnets:2007,
	Abstract = {Abstract One special class of molecular magnets may be characterized as a finite array of exchange-coupled transition metal ions that are held in place by ligands. Depending upon the relative strength of the exchange-coupling and the spin-orbit interactions, two different types of collective excitations can emerge as the low-energy excitations. When spin-orbit interactions are negligible, the lowest excitations are generally highly correlated and are associated with changes in spin-coupling. Such systems may be described within a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. A description of how to calculate parameters for such a Hamiltonian is presented in this work. However, the phenomenon now referred to as resonant tunnelling of magnetization (RTM) occurs when the exchange coupling is sufficiently strong that the electronic ground state of the molecule may be well idealized as a single Ising-like configuration of spin-ordered metal centers. Within this idealization the spin-orbit energy depends upon axis of spin-quantization and the magnetic behavior can be described in terms of a simple anisotropy Hamiltonian. In this work we review these points through discussions of two nanostructures which here are respectively referred to as the V15 spin molecular magnet and the Mn12-Acetate anisotropic molecular magnet. The distinctions between these two classes are reviewed. In particular we emphasize that more complicated collective behaviors may occur in cases with either low-energy electronic excitations or for cases where a decoupling of the kinetic-exchange and spin-orbit interaction energies does not occur. For the latter idealized case, it is still somewhat remarkable that the anisotropy Hamiltonians of many of the AMM may be computationally determined from second-order perturbative analyses of the collinear spin-ordered state within an all-electron density-functional formalism. The primary emphasis of this work is to provide many details related to the perturbative derivation of the Hamiltonian for an AMM. A combination of analytic and computational techniques are used in the derivation.},

	Abstract = {EPR spectroscopists have refined the art of interpreting experimental results by means of an effective spin-Hamiltonian (SH) to a high degree of sophistication [1]. The SH parameters are the principal outcome of an EPR experiment and represent a concise summary of the information content of the experiments. However, the power of the SH approach extends far beyond summarizing experimental results. The SH describes the physics of spin systems so well that it can be used to creatively design new experiments. The behavior of the spin system can be simulated in advance through exact solutions of the quantum mechanical equations of motions in the SH formalism. In this respect it is of major utility that the SH is so simple---it usually works in a low-dimensional Hilbert space that is only spanned by the (effective) spin degrees of freedom of the system under investigation [2]. Due to this simplicity, exact solutions are relatively easy to generate with ordinary computational hardware, or, in many cases, just with paper and pencil.},
