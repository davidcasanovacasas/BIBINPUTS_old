	Abstract = {Publisher Summary Natural orbitals could be used to write a two-electron wave function in a simple canonical form. This form gave much more rapid convergence than the usual configuration-interaction wave function. Shull and L{\"o}wdin applied this theory to the helium ground state. Shull converted most of the then existent hydrogen molecule ground-state wave functions to natural orbital form. This early work has been the inspiration for most of the use of natural orbitals. For many-electron systems, the simplicity introduced in the two-electron system by natural orbitals does not appear. Only for certain restricted classes of wave functions are the number of terms reduced. By careful study of the wave function in natural orbital form it has been possible to develop an intuition about correlation effects which was missing earlier. Configuration-interaction wave functions based on natural orbitals are among the most accurate ever produced for many electron systems.},
