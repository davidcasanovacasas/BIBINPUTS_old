	n2 = {Abstract While methodological developments in the last decade made it possible to compute coupled cluster (CC) energies including excitations up to a perturbative triples correction for molecules containing several hundred atoms, a similar breakthrough has not yet been reported for excited state computations. Accurate CC methods for excited states are still expensive, although some promising candidates for an efficient and accurate excited state CC method have emerged recently. This review examines the various approximation schemes with particular emphasis on their performance for excitation energies and summarizes the best state-of-the-art results which may pave the way for a robust excited state method applicable to molecules of hundreds of atoms. Among these, special attention will be given to exploiting the techniques of similarity transformation, perturbative approximations as well as integral decomposition, local and embedding techniques within the equation of motion CC framework.

      to incorporate more at fifth order of MBPT than either CCSD or QCISD.
      Some test applications are presented.  The method is simpler than CCSD
      because all the singles amplitudes are zeroed, but it requires iterative
      solution of the orbitals, which means a transformation of the AO
      integrals is required for each iteration.  A (T) correction is given,
      and analytic gradient theory for the method is sketched.  It is seen

The reference state is described by the complete CC singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT) method. Excited states are generated from the reference state wave function by the action of a linear excitation operator including single, double, and triple excitations. The excited state wave functions and energies are obtained by diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian e(-T)He(T), where T is the cluster operator for the reference state, in the space of singly, doubly, and triply excited determinants. Comparison is made with full configuration interaction excitation energies for several examples (CH+, Be, SiH2, and CH2). These show that EOM-CCSDT is able to describe states which are doubly excited relative to the reference state, as well as singly excited states. Calculations of several excitation energies of BH using an extended basis set are also reported, and show good agreement with experiment.},

	optabstract = {We are proposing a new computational thermochemistry protocol denoted W3 theory, as a successor to W1 and W2 theory proposed earlier [Martin and De Oliveira, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 1843 (1999)]. The new method is both more accurate overall (error statistics for total atomization energies approximately cut in half) and more robust (particularly towards systems exhibiting significant nondynamical correlation) than W2 theory. The cardinal improvement rests in an approximate account for post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. Iterative T-3 (connected triple excitations) effects exhibit a basis set convergence behavior similar to the T-3 contribution overall. They almost universally decrease molecular binding energies. Their inclusion in isolation yields less accurate results than CCSD(T) nearly across the board: It is only when T-4 (connected quadruple excitations) effects are included that superior performance is achieved. T-4 effects systematically increase molecular binding energies. Their basis set convergence is quite rapid, and even CCSDTQ/cc-pVDZ scaled by an empirical factor of 1.2532 will yield a quite passable quadruples contribution. The effect of still higher-order excitations was gauged for a subset of molecules (notably the eight-valence electron systems): T-5 (connected quintuple excitations) contributions reach 0.3 kcal/mol for the pathologically multireference X (1)Sigma(g)(+) state of C-2 but are quite small for other systems. A variety of avenues for achieving accuracy beyond that of W3 theory were explored, to no significant avail. W3 thus appears to represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost for those seeking a robust method for computational thermochemistry in the kJ/mol accuracy range on small systems.},
