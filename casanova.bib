	Abstract = {Summary
π-Conjugated molecules with an annulene-within-an-annulene (AWA) super-ring structure have been pursued by chemists for a long time but with limited success. Here, we report the synthesis of two stable cyclopenta-ring-fused oligo(m-phenylene) macrocycles, 8MC-M and 10MC-M, both showing moderate polyradical character. The octaradicaloid 8MC-M exhibits a [24]annulene-within-[32]annulene structure, which is globally aromatic despite the fact that it possesses 4n π-electrons. Theoretical analyses reveal that the π-electrons in the inner and outer rings follow Baird's rule such that both are triplet biradicals, and overall the molecule is a ground-state spin singlet. The decaradicaloid 10MC-M also possesses a super-aromatic AWA structure with 30 and 40 π-electrons in the inner and outer rings, respectively. However, it has a triplet ground state with a singlet inner ring satisfying H{\"u}ckel's rule and a triplet outer ring following Baird's rule. Therefore, molecules with a decoupled AWA super-ring structure are eventually attained and also show unusual global aromaticity.},

We mostly used tight-binding and finite-temperature density-based methods, the former providing a simple but intuitive picture about their electronic structure, and the latter dealing effectively with strong correlation effects by relying on a fractional occupation number weighted electron density (ρFOD), with additional RAS-SF calculations backing up the latter results. We also explore how minor structural modifications of nanotube end-caps might influence the results, showing that topology, together with the chemical nature of the systems, is pivotal for the understanding of the electronic properties of these and other related systems.},

The spin-flip treatment exploits the different physics of low-spin and high-spin states and is based on the observation that correlation is small for same-spin electrons. By using a well-behaved high-spin state as a reference, one can access problematic low-spin states by deploying the same formal tools as in the excited-state treatments (i.e., linear response, propagator, or equation-of-motion theories). The Perspective reviews applications of this strategy within wave function and density functional theory frameworks as well as the extensions for molecular properties and spectroscopy. The utility of spin-flip methods is illustrated by examples. Limitations and proposed future directions are also discussed.},
